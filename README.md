# SeaOfSteves
Sea of Steves is the ocean adventure gameplay plugin where you hunt (and fight) for treasure! **It is designed to be used with a predominantly water-based islands map or generator.** We highly recommend [Isles of Alex](https://lectern.browsit.org/resources/resource/51/).

### PIRATE’S HONOR

All new sailors receive the same set of tools, including a sharp blade. No handouts here – all seafarers must rely on skill to prove they’re a cut above the rest!

### HIDDEN RICHES

Search for buried treasures along the sandy shores! Use your trusty divining rod to locate their exact position, but watch out – some of those chests are booby trapped! Sell your haul to merchants to get your name spread far and wide.

### TREACHEROUS WATERS

The ocean can be a scary place, but you brought firepower! Defend your booty from other raiders while sailing in your trusty vessel, but be warned – the depths beneath aren’t kind to strangers.
